# ebm-calibration

This repository calibrates 2- and 3-layer EBMs to data from 4xCO2 longRunMIP experiments. 

Input data is stored in `data/rtmt_tas_anom` and the EBM fit parameters are in `data/output`.

In order to reproduce the results and make the figures, build the conda environment from the .yml file and run the numbered scripts in order, while in `scripts/`.
